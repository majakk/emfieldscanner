    <string name="about">\n
    Field Scanner Pro aids in scanning your everyday environment for potentially harmful magnetic fields using the built in magnetic sensor in your phone. 
    This app thus aims to raise the awareness of such magnetic fields and help locate their sources.

    <string name="guide">\n
    The Field Scanner uses the phones built in compass or magnetometer sensor. If the sensor is overloaded by exerting strong magnetic fields it might need to be re-calibrated (RCAL has been lit).
    The symptom is often that the magnetic baseline is suspiciously high. Depending on the brand of the mobile device, this can usually be done by moving it in a figure eight or shaking it firmly.
    \n
    \n
    Common sources of magnetic fields include power transformers, electro-magnets (e.g. speakers) and fields resulting from electrical currents running through pipes and cables.

    Exported logs are saved onto the primary external storage device, e.g. SD card. The log file can then be imported for further analysis in e.g. Office Excel or similar.
